# TraceSANCertificate
PowerShell Cmdlet to Trace Hostnames in SAN Certificates

## About

This Module contains a Cmdlet that can be used to retrieve the valid hostnames specified as Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in a given certificate, and retrieves the certificate from each hostname.
Useful to see if the hostnames specified in a certificate are using the same certificate as the source certificate/host.

## Requirements
This Module is built upon .NET Core 3.1 and PowerShell 7.\
Tested against PowerShell 7.1 on Windows and Linux.

## Usage
```powershell
Trace-SANCertificate -Host www.example.com -Port 443 -TryPorts 443, 993 -Timeout 1000
```

This example will retrieve the certificate at the host "www.example.com" on TCP Port 443. It will then parse any SANs that are a valid hostname in the certificate and attempt to retrieve a certificate from each on the ports specified by "-TryPorts" parameter
